      MISSION</br>
      My belief is that you can make your immediate reality however
      you wish it to be, but you must first let yourself imagine anything and
      everything that is extraordinary. Art is a bridge that connects the
      dream and the waking world. My goal is to help build it. </br> </br>
      BIO </br>
      I started to explore my creative self during a very disorienting childhood. I kept
      drawing people, places, and symbols that I would see in the dream
      because I wanted to keep a piece of the dream with me during my waking
      hours. But as it is with most of us as we grow, the responsibilities and
      trials of daily life sometimes overwhelm us. So for a time, I was
      closed to the dreamworld and focused on survival and on building a
      stable life for many sleepless nights. I traveled thousands of miles to
      a different land. I severed ties, formed new friendships, and rebuilt
      broken bonds. Now, I am once again returning to my creative self and
      exploring the dream with art along with the ambition to close the gap
      between the dream and the waking world. I have been sleeping soundly and
      dreaming ever since. I currently reside in the Norwegian wilderness with
      my guardian cat and my best friend.
